GBC, GBA, and GBA SP-001 are scanned directly to the screen without the case or layers of glass on top of it, and scanned by Colormunki Photo. Used Spotread to read that gives out XYZ values on a terminal that I copy and pasted to a note before I put them in HCFR to save as CHC file.

OG Switch was scanned from Colormunki Display with the brightness set to middle and auto-brightness off, and fully charged. The screen was warmed up by 20 minutes before scanning.
My OG 3DS Top Screen was also scanned from Colormunki Display with brightness set to 5, at 80 nits. All the data are in the CHC except the saturation levels as it crashed during it due to faulty SD card, but the primaries, greyscale, and near black and white levels are there.
